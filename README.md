NAME

dircleaner - The directory cleaner

SYNOPSIS

This program cleans from a determined folder files that are older than
the number of seconds specified on the command line.  They can be deleted,
compressed and/or archived.

DESCRIPTION

 -p [directory] directory to work on.  Work with or without the trailing
                slash
 -s [seconds]   defines the number of seconds of difference between the
                actual time and the file's mtime
                 
 -a [d,a,c,ca]	action to be taken on the files:
		
		d:	file is deleted.
		a:	file is archived in a directory called archive inside the path.
			If the directory does not exist, it is created
		c:	file is compressed with gzip
		ca:	actions of _c_ and _a_.

EXAMPLES

To remove all files older than one hour in /tmp:

        dircleaner.pl -p /tmp -s 3600 -a d

To compress and archive files older than one month in /tmp:

	dircleaner.pl -p /tmp -s 2592000 -a ca


CAVEAT

This script uses the unlink perl function.  If the file has multiple links, it 
will not be deleted elsewhere.
